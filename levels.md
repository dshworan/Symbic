# Level Management

The LevelManager class is already set up to handle levels, but we need to integrate it with the game state
We'll need to track the current level in the game state
We'll need to handle level progression when puzzles are completed

# Game State Updates

Current state likely has a single grid size and puzzle
Need to modify to:
Use the current level's grid size (4x4, 6x6, 8x8, 10x10)
Load puzzles from the current level's puzzle array
Track which puzzle in the level is currently being played

# UI Adaptations

The game board needs to dynamically adjust its size based on the current level
The SVG shapes need to change based on the current level's shapes
The color scheme needs to update based on the current level's colors
Need to add level progression UI (level number, progress within level)

# Puzzle Loading

Need to implement logic to:
Load the correct puzzle from the current level
Handle puzzle completion and progression to next puzzle
Handle level completion and progression to next level

# Game Logic Updates

The rules system needs to be aware of the current level's grid size
Hint system needs to work with different grid sizes
Validation needs to work with different grid sizes

# Data Flow

Need to establish how the LevelManager will interact with:
Game state management
UI components
Puzzle loading
Progress tracking

# Storage

Need to track:
Current level
Progress within level
Completed puzzles
